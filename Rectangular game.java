// QUESTION:

// The Smart Beaver from ABBYY decided to have a day off. But doing nothing the whole day turned out to be too boring, and he decided to play a game with pebbles. Initially, the Beaver has n pebbles. He arranges them in 'a' equal rows, each row has 'b' pebbles (a > 1). Note that the Beaver must use all the pebbles he has, i. e. n = a·b.

 
// 10 pebbles are arranged in two rows, each row has 5 pebbles
// Once the Smart Beaver has arranged the pebbles, he takes back any of the resulting rows (that is, b pebbles) and discards all other pebbles. Then he arranges all his pebbles again (possibly choosing other values of a and b) and takes back one row, and so on. The game continues until at some point the Beaver ends up with exactly one pebble.

// The game process can be represented as a finite sequence of integers c1, ..., ck, where:

// c1 = n
// ci + 1 is the number of pebbles that the Beaver ends up with after the i-th move, that is, the number of pebbles in a row after some arrangement of ci pebbles (1 ≤ i < k). Note that ci > ci + 1.
// ck = 1
// The result of the game is the sum of numbers ci. You are given n.
// Write a program to find the maximum possible result of the game.



// INPUT & OUTPUT FORMAT:
// The input contains a single integer n — the initial number of pebbles the Smart Beaver has.
// The input limitations for getting 30 points are:
// 2 ≤ n ≤ 50
// The input limitations for getting 100 points are:
// 2 ≤ n ≤ 109
// The output displays the maximum possible result of the game.
// Text in bold represents the output.
// SAMPLE INPUT & OUTPUT 1:

// 10
// 16
// SAMPLE INPUT & OUTPUT 2:
// 8
// 15


// Code:

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        //gets user input
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        //to store result of the game
        int result = n;
        for (int i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {
            while (n % i == 0) {
                n /= i;
                result += n;
            }
        }
        //if the n pebbles greater than 1
        if (n > 1) {
            result++;
        }
        //display the maximum possible reuslt of the game
        System.out.println(result);
    }
}
